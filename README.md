> A app that retrieves the temperature in a city that is typed into the search built using React, ReactDOM, React-Router, Webpack, Babel, Foundation & SSCSS.

I built this to practice React.

Install and Run:


``` bash
git https://github.com/alexthedar/react-weather.git

cd react-weather

npm install

webpack

npm run start

```

TODO:

- add auth on front end and backend
- styling is boring
- Responsive navbar is clunky at tablet
